                    I’m a passionate Frontend Developer with 1.5 years of hands-on project experience, specializing in building user-friendly and performant web interfaces using <span className="text-secondary">React</span> and <span className="text-secondary">Next.js</span>. I have a strong foundation in modern web technologies such as <span className="text-secondary">HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)</span> and <span className="text-secondary">TypeScript</span>.

                <p className="mt-6">
                    I build responsive and accessible UIs using tools like <span className="underline">Tailwind CSS, Material UI, Chakra UI,</span> and <span className="underline">Bootstrap</span>. I also work with CSS preprocessors like Sass to streamline and optimize the styling process. When it comes to state management, I am experienced with <span className="text-secondary">Redux Toolkit, Context API</span>, and <span className="text-secondary">Zustand</span>.

                <p className="mt-6">
                    I’m comfortable with <span className="text-secondary">RESTful API</span> integration and have developed basic backend logic using <span className="text-secondary">Next.js API Routes</span>. My workflow includes tools like <span className="text-secondary">Git & GitHub</span> (advanced branching, merging, and pull requests), <span className="text-secondary">npm</span>, and <span className="text-secondary">Vite</span>. I’m also familiar with web performance tools such as <span className="text-secondary">Chrome DevTools</span>, <span className="text-secondary">Lighthouse</span>, and <span className="text-secondary">Core Web Vitals</span>, with a solid understanding of rendering strategies like <span className="text-secondary">CSR, SSR</span>, and <span className="text-secondary">SSG</span>.

                    During my internship, I improved mobile and tablet responsiveness using Tailwind CSS, integrated RESTful APIs for dynamic data handling, and collaborated with backend developers to ensure smooth data flow. I participated in debugging and documenting UI components and resolved bugs across various modules, contributing to application stability while following Git-based version control workflows.

                    I’m currently in my final year as a <span className="text-secondary">Computer Science student</span> with a focus on mathematics. At <span className="text-secondary">23 years old</span>, I’m highly motivated to apply my skills in real-world projects, collaborate with teams, and continue growing as a developer in a professional environment.
